            <p>
                Edward Abbey was born in Pennsylvania on January 29th, 1927, and died on March 14th, 1989.

                Best known for his conservation work and writing, Edward Abbey has long been considered a towering
                figure among environmentalists, known for his uncompromising conservation stances and anarchistic tendencies. His writing, so eloquent 
                and powerful, evoked adventure in his readers, and his crass humor and middle finger to 
                the establishment provided a sense of camaraderie. 
            </p>
            <p>
                His spirit lives on through his writings, and his soul in the desert; disregarding all state and federal laws,
                fittingly enough, his friends buried him illegally in the

            </p>
            <p>
                His last message, to give to anyone asking about his final words: "No comment."

                His best known work is perhaps <em>Desert Solitaire</em>, written in 1968 about his experiences
                in Utah and lauded for its fierce, poetic imagery. Another is <em> The 
                Monkey Wrench Gang</em>, a book about environmentalists who sought to protect the wilderness
                using guerilla-like tactics. Both are now considered necessary reads for any adventurer seeking to understand
                and protect this beautiful planet we call home before it's too late.
